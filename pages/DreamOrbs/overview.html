I really don't understand how to make auto-generated wiki pages.... 

Lest say I want to create a page for dream orbs... I would make a introductory text of what are they and where/how to get them and this would go in pokeclicker-wiki/data/Dream Orbs/overview-description.md. 

But then I will want to have a list of the items each drem orb can give and there I have to options:

 a) forget about the auto-generated functions of this wiki and do it manually (easier but reaaaaly meeeh)

b) make it auto-generated in pokeclicker-wiki/pages/Dream Orbs/overview.html that would be a html table starting with a easy header like this



<div class="table-responsive">

    <table class="table table-hover table-striped table-bordered">

        <thead class="thead-dark">

            <tr>

                <th>Item</th>

                <th>Chance</th>

            </tr>

        </thead>

```

But then I don't know how to call the data that is in pokeclicker/src/scripts/towns/DreamOrbController.ts in the body of the table

I think should be something like:

```

<tbody data-bind="foreach: ??? ">

    <td >??? </td>

    <td >??? </td>

```

But I don't know what to put in the ??? To call the info
<!-- ko foreach: App.game.dreamOrbController.orbs -->

    <div>

        <h1 data-bind="text: $data.color"></h1>

        <table>

            <thead>

                <tr>

                    <th>Item Name</th>

                    <th>Item Type</th>

                    <th>Chance</th>

                </tr>

            </thead>

            <tbody>

                <!-- ko foreach: Wiki.dreamOrbs.getOrbLoot($data) -->

                <tr>

                    <td data-bind="text: $data.name"></td>

                    <td data-bind="text: $data.itemType"></td>

                    <td data-bind="text: `${($data.chance * 100).toLocaleString()}%`"></td>

                </tr>

                <!-- /ko -->

            </tbody>

        </table>

    </div>

    <!-- /ko -->
